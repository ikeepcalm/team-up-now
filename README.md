# Team Up Now
Telegram bot designed to connect different gamers with each other based on their interests
# What is it? 
Oddly enough, it's a kind of open-source 
Telegram bot that aims to introduce two complete strangers based on their common interests. 
Or not even two, but three, four, or even more! 
If you want and have time, you can try to find a whole clan to spend time with. 
# How does it work?
It's very simple. At the very beginning, each user gradually fills out a small player profile, 
indicating their favorite games, their age group, a short description, maybe even a photo, 
after which the bot builds a list of people with similar interests over time, after which they can look through each other's profiles, 
and finally, if both people are satisfied with the allies they have found, 
they can write to each other to arrange to play together. If not, it doesn't matter, 
there are countless people in the world!
